# Homework5: This app is designed to allow a user to schedule a day's events by hour. The date is displayed at the top of the page, and the schedule runs from 9AM to 5PM, standard business hours. The schedule rows are color coded, gray for an hour that has passed, red for the current hour, and green for a future hour such that users can immediately see which tasks are relevant. As for adding events, the center column can be edited to add or remove events, and the save button on the right stores the content to local storage, allowing the edited schedule to be accessed after the page has been closed.
